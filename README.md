# About
Game Maker Studio Project: APPLES! (2018)

The game features drag & drop controls, sorting the objects up and down the moving trays so that the objects could end up in their respective boxes. The goal is to sort all the matching apples in their boxes. Everything else goes into trash! Otherwise you won't get all the points :)

Below you will find Youtube links to the gamepay showcase with a couple of different versions of the game in progress.

Graphics were made with Adobe Photoshop and GM:Studio's internal graphics editor.
