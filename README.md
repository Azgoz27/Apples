Game Maker Project


Game Maker Studio Project: APPLES!
The code in this repository is the first serious game project made by myself and my brother 
The game features drag&drop controls, sorting the objects up and down the moving trays so that the objects could end up in their respective boxes. 
Below you will find Youtube links to the gamepay showcase with a couple of different versions of the game in progress.

Programming was done with GML scripting language using the Game Maker: Studio 
Graphics are made with Adobe Photoshop 

version 0.3 shows the basic game idea with very raw graphics and controls. This version is only to show what the general idea here is.
