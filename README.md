# Apples!
The Game Maker Project

#This is a work in progress! When reviewing the code, some might find confusing the GM's disclammer on the top saying the code is auto generated by GM. Only the code in "<>" is auto generated by GM.

# About
Game Maker Studio Project: APPLES! (2018)

The game features drag & drop controls, sorting the objects up and down the moving trays so that the objects could end up in their respective boxes. The goal is to sort all the matching apples in their boxes. Everything else goes into trash! Otherwise you won't get all the points :)

Below you will find Youtube links to the gamepay showcase with a couple of different versions of the game in progress.
